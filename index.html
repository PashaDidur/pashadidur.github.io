						<p>Akasha is a Sanskrit word meaning “primary substance” – that out of which all things are formed.</p>
						<hr class="hr_descr">
						<p>The Akashic Records contain a vibrational record of every soul and its journey on Earth through time. </p>
					</div>
					
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-6">
					<div class="right_descr">
						<p>The Records are known by various names in many spiritual traditions.  The Records were accessed by ancient people in many cultures – Chinese, Tibetan, Indian, Egyptian, Persian, Greek, Hebrew, Christian, Druid, and Mayan, among others. 	For example, in the Judeo-Christian tradition it is referred to as <span>The Book of 	Life and The Book of God’s Remembrance.</span></p>
						<p>The primary experience of being in the Akashic Records is one of being known, loved, understood, and accepted.  Perceptions, awarenesses, and insights not commonly available to us become apparent from the soul-perspective of the Records.  To be embraced in the energy of the Akashic Records is to be received with great love, respect, and appreciation.</p>

In the Records we may gain useful information to guide your soul’s evolving journey, to assist you in living an inspired life.</p>

						<div class="about_text">
							<p>I am delighted that you have found my website. Allow me to tell you a bit about my journey as a healer, educator, and intuitive.</p>
							<p>My spiritual journey has been universal. It spans the Judeo-Christian spheres, mystical teachings of the East and West, and several Earth-centered traditions. For me, diversity and mystery are the ways of Spirit.</p>
							<p>My first mystical experience at age 3 initiated a lifelong process of spiritual discovery and soulful unfolding. This encounter – being completely embraced by a Loving Presence beyond my human experience – has sustained me throughout my life.</p>
							<p>Life has posed many challenges to that early awareness of the Sacred. My personal journey has not been an easy one. I have experienced periods of soul crushing depression and disconnection from Spirit and body. I am familiar with the magnitude of this human experience – the sweet, and the bitter. A keen sense of humor, a curious mind, and a willing heart, have eased passage through the darkest nights.</p>
							<p>I have come home to reading the Akashic Records after 30-plus years of sitting with clients as a counselor and educator – including psychotherapy, addictions counseling, pastoral counseling, and community education.</p>

							<p>When I was first guided to read my own Akashic Record, I realized that this was a “place” I had entered many times in numerous ways over the years, without recognizing it as the Akasha. Now I use the Pathway Prayer Process© to intentionally enter the Records. </p>
							<p>In my own Record, I am continually awed at the clarity, wisdom, and compassion offered which guides me to deeper levels of healing past wounds, breaking free of limiting patterns, beliefs, and behaviors, and taking action to become my best self. </p>
							<p>I find it a joy to enter this sacred space of the Akasha to experience its gentle energy. </p>
							<p>Here on Earth, this seems an especially trying time to be in a body and consciously walk a spiritual path. In this time of transition, the most important thing I can do is to embrace the Light within, be the Love I want to see in the world, and help others to see their Divine Nature. In doing so, we are all freed to follow our unique path. </p>
							<p>It is a privilege to be present with you and in service to you.</p>

							<p>For many years I wanted to receive an Akashic Records reading, but somehow the reading never happened. Last month, I had the opportunity to have a reading with Cheryl and I trust now that not only was this the time I was suppose to have my records read, but that it was Cheryl who was meant to read them. </p>
							<p>At times, I struggled to communicate my thoughts through questions clearly; however, the answers contained the underlying answers to deeper questions I had not even asked. I received a tremendous amount of validation that my intuition regarding situations, people and the timing of events was accurate. </p>
							<p>Additionally, aspects of the answers were communicated through clear metaphorical and visual examples. These I wrote down and they continue to be clear reminders of the most valuable messages I received during the reading. There were many practical suggestions on how to accomplish the specifics of what I was asking. Re-reading my notes has helped me return to better practices to achieve my personal, interpersonal and professional goals. </p>
							<p>Overall, the reading with Cheryl helped me to feel more optimistic about my future and gave me a greater sense of clarity about how to increase my abundance and proceed more effectively in my relationships. Several times during the reading, I found the answers to be so comforting… it was as if Cheryl and all the guides knew what was in my heart. The reading brought me peace and affirmed my inner strength. This continues to help me to move forward with renewed hope and clarity. </p>
							<p>I have received many types of readings and healings from various practitioners, spiritual guides and channels over the years. Cheryl has a gift for doing these readings. I am so thankful that I had the opportunity to receive so much beautiful guidance through her. Easily, I give her my highest recommendation.</p>

								<h2>What is an Akashic Records reading?</h2>
								<hr class="hr_about">
							</div>
							<div class="left_reading">
								<p>An Akashic Records reading is a one-on-one conversation between the reader and the person whose Records are being read. The reading is focused on a question (or questions) posed by the person seeking a reading. A reading may be in person or by telephone / video conference, and is generally 45-60 minutes in length.</p>
								<p>While there are many avenues to enter the Records, I utilize the Pathway Prayer Process©. This process provides a reliable and deliberate means to access the consciousness of the Records mindfully and effectively.</p>
